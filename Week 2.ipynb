    "* Introduce you to important concepts that allow us to operationalize ideas such as **Data Generating Processes** (or DGPs).\n",
    "    * **All of this can be done using material you have already seen in RE Finance, RE Capital Markets or RPM.**\n",
    "    * Ideally these concepts will help \n",
    "* Painful but **necessary**.\n",
    "    * We should pay respect for the 300 years of history that has brought us here.\n",
    "* **These ideas should complement your understanding of real estate finance.**"

    "* Distribution functions are mathematical abstractions (like demand curves).\n",

    "* Classical view holds that probability is based on the history of outcomes from an experiment, such as the probability the stock market goes up tomorrow or P(stock market goes up tomorrow)."
